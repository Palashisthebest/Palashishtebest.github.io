  <h1>Hello, GitHub Pages!</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Palash Vyas. I’m a high school student who loves building cool stuff, whether it’s coding a stopwatch at a hackathon or helping lead my robotics team at competitions. I’m also into debate, teaching, and public service—I’ve coached middle schoolers, taught neurodivergent kids, and interned for a state assemblymember. I like solving problems, learning hands-on, and working with people who want to make things better and. </p>
